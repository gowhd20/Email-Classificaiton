# Email-Classificaiton

In this project, we demonstrate a multiple classification solutions mainly around machine learning algorithms to filter out spam emails. We noticed general classifiers such as SVM perform very well over easy tasks, however, they struggle when the barrier between legitimate and spam emails become blurred (i.e. for the cases when so-called ?spam-like legitimate (ham) emails? are added to the dataset).

We have collected 3839 ham, and 1143 spam emails from our email accounts. Then later, we expand the volume of the dataset to 12952 and 8619 emails for ham and spam respectively by adding Spam-Assassin and Ling-Spam data corpus.
